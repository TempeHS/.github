## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Tempe High School is a proud inner-west public high school. Our dedicated Technologies team supports learning across all TAS disciplines, supporting all students to realise their designs. We specialise in design, game development, animation/videography, mechatronics, manufacturing (adaptive and subtractive), textiles, web development, Fusion360, and all facets of engineering.

🌈 Contribution guidelines — As a high school, we are closed to outside our student body, but we openly share all resources outward. Power to the sharers...
