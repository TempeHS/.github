## Hi there üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Tempe High School is a proud inner-west public high school. Our dedicated Technologies team supports learning across all TAS disciplines. Together, we support all students in realising their design ambitions. Within our team, we have specialists in architecture, jewellery, graphic design, game development, furnishings, animation, videography, mechatronics, manufacturing (additive and subtractive), textiles, web development, 3D design, and all facets of engineering.

üåà Contribution guidelines ‚Äî As a high school, we are closed to contributions outside our student body, but we openly share all resources outward. Power to the sharers...

üçø Fun facts - No hampsters were hurt in the process of making these resources.

üßô Remember, anyone can make something, but they need someone to design it first. Don't be a maker; be a designer.
